        <h3><a href="https://github.com/chrisAmh/inundata.git">INUNDATA: Mapping Floods in South Africa</a></h3>
        <p>Participating in a research initiative addressing urban and rural flood risks in South Africa, focusing on building a machine learning model to predict the precise day of urban flash flood occurrences. Key tasks included:
          Utilizing CHIRPS daily precipitation data and composite earth observation imagery for flood event detection.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/chrisAmh/GeoAi.git">GeoAi Agricultural Plastic Cover Mapping with Satellite Imagery</a></h3>
        <p>Participated in the AI for Good initiative to address environmental concerns related to agricultural plastic use.
          Developed machine learning (Light GBM) model for mapping agricultural plastic covers using freely available satellite data.
          Implemented indices methods to engineer features for handling agricultural plastic covers on land-use in Kenya, Spain, and Vietnam.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/chrisAmh/IAHR_Rainfall_Data_Analysis.git">Optimization of Water Treatment Plants for Mine Closure (Gold Sim Approach)</a></h3>
        <p>Developed a detailed water balance model to determine the number of treatment plants required to close a mine site within five years.
          Conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate different water treatment arrangements with a minimum 70% probability of success.
          Assessed climate change trends and their impact on the water balance model</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/chrisAmh/Floodzone.git">Crowdsourced Flood Mapping Web Application</a></h3>
        <p>Aim to track the real-time impact of floods on transportation networks using flood-related hashtags in Ghana.
          Provide real-time map updates of flood-prone areas, during extreme weather events.
          Implement sentiment analysis from social media data to understand public perceptions of disruptions due to flooding.</p>

        <h3><a href="#project-link">Evaluation of the Impact of Activities in the Sisa Catchment on Sisa Stream</a></h3>
        <p>Employed HEC-RAS to model stream flow and analyze flood risks.
          Conducted land-cover analysis using GIS to map and assess the impact of land-use changes on the stream.
          Identified significant changes in land use patterns contributing to increased flood risks.</p>
